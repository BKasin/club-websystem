  <h2>Meetings</h2>
  <p>We generally have a formal meeting every other Wednesday during the Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters. These consist of guest speakers from the cybersecurity industry, hands-on workshops from students, or relevant presentations about cyber topics. Fridays (and sometimes Saturdays) are used for ongoing projects. Check our <a href="#">Events Page</a> for an up-to-date list.</p>
  <p>We are always open to suggestions, so if you have an idea for a workshop or guest speaker, please <a href="{% url 'about' %}">let us know</a>.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>Our university department emphasizes learning <em>outside the classroom</em>. There are many subjects in cybersecurity which simply cannot be learned in a lecture-style classroom, so our lab provides space to build, break, secure, and experiment with technology. These experiences add invaluable skills to your repertoire, and gives you tangible stories to tell in job interviews that demonstrate your problem-solving skills.</p>
  <p>As a member of the InfoSec Club, you may jump into any project at any time. For more information on each projects, including those that are just in the idea phase, see our <a href="#">Projects Page</a>. Feel free to <a href="{% url 'about' %}">tell us your ideas</a> as well.</p>

  <h2>Our Lab</h2>
  <p>We operate primarily out of Jack Brown room 122 (affectionately known as "the lab"). We do our best to keep it open on a consistent schedule. If you'd like the lab open outside of these hours, <a href="{% url 'about' %}">contact one of the club officers</a>.</p>
  <p>For the <em>Spring 2015 quarter</em>:</p>
